# quiz_app
Displays random quizes
## Contributors
The project was developed by Justine Kenyansa.

## :flashlight: Description
This is a simple app that allows the user to answer timed quizzes.

## BDD
If the user does not answer within 10 sec, it is counted as though they answered it wrong. They cannot select anything. <br>
The user also gets a pop up message of "Time Ended!!" <br>
You can only move to the next question by clicking the "next" button. <br>
At the end, the app tallies correct answers and presents to the result.

## :computer: Technologies Used
 The project used HTML, css, and Vanilla JS.
